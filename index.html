<h2><b>📑Creating Config File for More Clouds</b></h2>
<p><b>You can learn creating config file for all Cloud Services: <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/">Learn Here</a></b></p>
<h2><b>🪝Multi Cloud Transfer</b></h2>
<p><b>Lets move Data from any cloud to any cloud as you want! Since we are using Colab, So it will not consume your Internet or System Resource.</b></p>
<h4><b>1.Before we procced! I recommend to either create or fetch your Rclone Config file to Google Colab using above two methods! Creating and fetching will automatically place the file in correct location!</b></h4>
<img src="Img/24.png">
<h4><b>2.Once you done creating or fetching the config file! Just run the Code named "Connect to Cloud Accounts" and it will automatically detect your config file and will show you  dropdown list to mount multiple remotes as shown in the image. Now select remoted and click mount to connect to those remotes between which you have to transfer your Data.</b></h4>
<img src="Img/25.png">
<h4><b>3.After mounting those remotes or Cloud Accounts, Now click on the File icon as shown in the image and then you will see two folder named "drives" open the second folder named "drives" and you will see the names of Remotes or Cloud Account which you mounted previously!</b></h4>
<img src="Img/26.png">
<h4><b>4.Now Simply open that Folder and copy the file or folder path which needs to be copied and then right click on the file or folder and select "Copy Path" option from the list</b></h4>
<img src="Img/27.png">
<h4><b>5.After that! Paste the path of file or folder in "Source" field and again go to File Icon-->drives and open the Cloud Account into which you want to transfer files/folders and copy its path! You can either directly copy the path of Cloud Account or of any folder inside it and paste the path in "destination" field.</b></h4>
<img src="Img/28.png">
<h4><b>6.Choose the Transfer mode trough which you want to transfer your Data! Please refer to "<a href="#modes-of-transfer">🚅Modes of Transfer</a>" below to learn about all of them.</b></h4>
<h4><b>7.If you want to get notified! when your transfer got completed then tick the Email_notification option and provide Gmail Email ID as well as its password and the Receiver Email ID on which you want to receive the notification!  (optional)</b></h4>
<p><b>
  Email_notification: Select this option to enable following options.<br>
  logs: Check this option to also get log in Mail.<br>
  emailID: Enter your Gmail ID.<br>
  password: Enter Password of given Gmail ID.<br>
  Receiver_ID: The Email ID on which you want to receive the Notification.
  </p></b>
<img src="Img/29.png">
<h4><b>8.Dry Run option is just to check the Source as well as destination path without copying anything.(Optional)</b></h4>
<h4><b>9.Finally! Run the code by pressing Play button to start transferring. Enjoy!🙃</b></h4>
<h2><b>🪀Using Service Accounts</b></h4>
<h4><b>The service accounts can be used to bypass the 750Gb/day upload limit set by google in Google Drive. It means that you can use them to upload more than 750Gb per day, duplicate hundreds of files...Each service account has a 750Gb upload limit per day. You can create up to 100 service account per google cloud project. So, with only one project you can upload/duplicate up to 75Tb a day!</b></h4>
  <h4><b>1.Don't have Service Accounts?<a href="https://telegra.ph/How-to-create-and-use-service-accounts-sa-03-31" alt="Creating SA"> Create Here</a></b></h4>
  <h4><b>2.After creating! make the zip of "accounts" folder which have 100 Json files and keep its name as "accounts.zip".</b></h4>
  <h4><b>3.Now back to Google Colab screen and run the code as shown in the Image and click "Choose file" and select the zip file you just created!</b></h4>
  <img src="Img/31.png">
  <h4><b>4.After it! Click the file icon, then open "accounts" folder and right click on anyone json file and select "Copy path".</b></h4>
  <img src="Img/32.png">
  <h4><b>5.Run the "Create/Edit/Delete Rclone Config File" and paste the path in "service_account_file" during createing remote for Google Drive.</b></h4>

<h2><b>🚅Modes of Transfer</b></h2>
<h4><b>As this project use Rclone as a base! and Rclone support multiple flags to help you move or clean your Data, in this Project flags are known as Modes. Here is the list of the Modes that this Project supports:</b></h4>
  <h4><b>1.Copy: Copy files from source to dest, skipping identical files.</b></h4>
  <h4><b>2.Copyto: This can be used to upload single files to other than their current name.</b></h4>
  <h4><b>3.CopyURL: Download a URL's content and copy it to the destination without saving it in temporary storage.</b></h4>
  <h4><b>4.Move: Moves the contents of the source directory to the destination directory.</b></h4>
  <h4><b>5.Moveto: If source:path is a file or directory then it moves it to a file or directory named dest:path.</b></h4>
  <h4><b>6.Check: Checks the files in the source and destination match. It compares sizes and hashes (MD5 or SHA1) and logs a report of files that don't match. It doesn't alter the source or destination.</b></h4>
  <h4><b>7.Sync: Sync the source to the destination, changing the destination only. Doesn't transfer files that are identical on source and destination, testing by size and modification time or MD5SUM. Destination is updated to match source, including deleting files if necessary (except duplicate objects, see below).</b></h4>
  <h4><b>8.Bisync: Bisync provides a bidirectional cloud sync solution in rclone. It retains the Path1 and Path2 filesystem listings from the prior run. On each successive run it will:</b></h4>
  <h4><b>9.Cat: Rclone cat sends any files to standard output.</b></h4>
  <h4><b>10.CleanUp: Clean up the remote if possible. Empty the trash or delete old file versions. Not supported by all remotes.</b></h4>
  <h4><b>11.ls: List all the objects in the path with size and path.</b></h4>
  <h4><b>12.lsd: List all directories/containers/buckets in the path.</b></h4>
  <h4><b>13.lsl: List all the objects in the path with size, modification time and path.</b></h4>
  <h4><b>14.md5sum: Produce an md5sum file for all the objects in the path.</b></h4>
  <h4><b>15.sha1sum: Produce a sha1sum file for all the objects in the path.</b></h4>
  <h4><b>16.size: Return the total size and number of objects in path.</b></h4>
  <h4><b>17.genautocomplete: Output shell completion scripts for rclone.</b></h4>
  <h4><b>18.gendocs: Output markdown docs for rclone to the directory supplied.</b></h4>
  <h4><b>19.obscure: Obscure password for use in the rclone.conf.</b></h4>
  <p><b>20.tree: List the contents of the remote in a tree like fashion.</b></p>
  <p><b>Following Modes can easily cause Data Loss:</b></p>
  <h4><b>1.Delete: Remove the files in path.</b></h4>
  <h4><b>2.Purge: Will delete whole Directory and leaving nothing behind.</b></h4>
  <h4><b>3.rmdir: Completely Delete the given path.</b></h4>
  <h4><b>4.rmdirs: Remove any empty directories under the path.</b></h4>
<h2><b>🎯Points to be Remembered</b></h2>
<h4><b>1.Always choose No (n) for Auto-Config because we are not going to use Rclone on our Local Device/Machine otherwise login will not work!</b></h4>
<h4><b>2.Don't forget to type '!' before executing any custom Rclone Command.</b></h4>
<h4><b>3.For Safety! Rclone will always save progress in your My Drive! Not in any of your Shared Drive.</b></h4>
<h4><b>4.Use the Dry Run option to check both Source and Destination path without copying anything.</b></h4>
<h4><b>5.You can either choose the path of Cloud Account folder or anyother folder inside it</b></h4>

<h2><b>🤔Why use this?</b></h4>
<h4><b>1.Rclone is really a very powerful command line tool! but some users are really not comfortable with Command line and hence it become defficult to use this type of useful tools, So this Project provides a very interactive User Interface (UI) to operate it with less inputs.</b></h4>
<h4><b>2.Rclone creates "rclone.conf"  file, which is the most important thing to make rclone useful. But when you change your device, then you have to create a new rclone.conf file. But this Project saves your rclone.conf file to Google Drive and you can use the same file repeatedly, what you just need is your Google Account and nothing.</b></h4>
<h4><b>3.Heavy flexibility: You can use this project anytime & anywhere because it is totally cloud based, that means if you are moving files in your PC and want to check its progress in your phone then you just have to login on Google Colab in your Phone.</b></h4>
<h2><b>🔐 Safe or Not? ✅</b></h2>
